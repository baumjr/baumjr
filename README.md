Software engineer, with over 10 years of experience in systems development, mainly back-end, also acting as technical leader of high performance teams.

Experience in different segments such as networks and monitoring, education, retail, integration and fintech. Enthusiastic about new technologists and curious
about disruptive solutions. I seek to contribute to the creation of solutions that help people in some way.
